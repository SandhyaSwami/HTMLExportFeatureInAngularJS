Welcome to the world of Multi-Image Responsive Carousel!
===================

 
[Demo](http://sandhyaswami.github.io/MultiImageResponsiveCarousel/index.html)
===
Now a days we are developing ***Responsive Web Applications*** and we want them should work across all the devices like 

 - ***Smart Phones***
 - ***Tablets***
 - ***Laptops and***
 - **On Extra Large Desktops Screens**

At the same time we want to have ***Single Code*** ***Base*** for all the above devices.

It is bit difficult to find a ***Responsive Carousel*** which works perfectly on all devices and at the same time it should be ***highly customisable*** and ***light weight***.

I have developed a very simple ***Multi-Image Carousel*** for all the devices using **bootstrap and jQuery.**

> **Note:**It is free, you can download and use in your personal applications as well as in commercial applications.
