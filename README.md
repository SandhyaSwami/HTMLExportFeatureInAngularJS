Now a  days a lot of applications requires to  have ***export features*** like ***HTML to PDF file, MS-Word and MS-Excel***.

I have searched it on internet but there were no plugins in AngularJS.

So  I  have developed a reusable component/plugin in AngularJS that can ***export table into various file formats like PDF, Word and  Excel***.
